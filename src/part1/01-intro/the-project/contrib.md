# Contributing and Following Along

The project maintains:

- **Detailed design documents** for all major features
- **Clear phase-based development** with defined milestones
- **Separation of concerns** across focused repositories
- **Systematic testing** via the coverage repository

This structure makes it possible for contributors to:

- Understand design rationale through the `design` repo
- Work on isolated features in focused repos
- Track progress through phase milestones
- Verify correctness through comprehensive tests

The Zylisp Guide (the book being written) serves as both:

- **Vision document** - what the language should become
- **Specification** - how features should work
- **Learning resource** - for future Zylisp developers

The Zylisp project represents a thoughtful, well-architected effort to create a production-ready Lisp that embraces modern language design whilst honouring the Lisp tradition. It's not trying to be everything to everyone, but rather to serve a specific niche: developers who want both Lisp's power and Go's practicality.
