# Why Zylisp?

The Zylisp project addresses a genuine gap in the language landscape:

**If you want Lisp's power**, you typically sacrifice:

- Static typing and tooling
- Mainstream ecosystem access
- Predictable performance

**If you want Go's practicality**, you sacrifice:

- Metaprogramming capabilities
- REPL-driven development
- Immutability by default

**Zylisp provides both:**

- Lisp's macros, homoiconicity, and interactive development
- Go's types, concurrency, performance, and ecosystem
- Modern features like pattern matching and persistent data structures
- Production-ready fault tolerance through supervision trees

It's designed for developers who want to build robust, concurrent systems with the productivity of Lisp and the reliability of Go.
