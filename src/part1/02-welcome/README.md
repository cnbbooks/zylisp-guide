# Welcome to Zylisp

This guide assumes you have programmed before, whether in Lisp, Go, or other languages. If you come from the Lisp tradition, you will recognize the s-expressions, the macros, and the functional style—but discover Go's concurrency primitives and struct-based object model. If you come from Go, you will recognize goroutines, channels, and interfaces—but discover pattern matching, immutable data structures, and compile-time metaprogramming. And if you come from elsewhere, you may find Zylisp a compelling synthesis of ideas that have each proven valuable in isolation.
